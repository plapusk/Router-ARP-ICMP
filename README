TEMA 1 PCOM

I organized this homework in two main problems, each with with 2 main chapters
	-IP
		-ICMP
		-Best route-table-entry
	-ARP
		-Request
		-Reply


* IP *
- ICMP -

The main problem here was if he had an ICMP ECHO addressed to us. In that
case we have to send back a reply messege. We do that by swaping the 
destination and source from the original IP header, change the tpye to
ECHO REPLY and then update the checksum.

We also have some issues that we have to deal with in this same category.
If we ever have package that has no more time to live or a package we can't 
find a route table entry, we have to reply the specific error we encountered

- Best route table entry -

 This would generally be very easy however to optimize the time a little 
 instead of searching the table through simple iteration we sorted the entry
 table and searched faster using Binary search. After that we can just send
 the packet to the next hop. There are some addition complications once we
 implement our own ARP system
 
 * ARP *
 
 - Request -
 
 If the request is not for us we can ignore it, otherwise we need to reply,
 which can easily be doen inverting the target and source address again
 
 - Reply -
 
 This is a little more complicated than the request. We have to first add the
 new mac address we received to the ARP table. Now because we have a new entry
 we have to check if any of the packets we have in our waiting queue 
 coresspond to the new mac address. We do that by getting the packet, 
 calculating the best route entry for all the packets, and seeing if the next
 hop is in our ARP table. If we unlcoked the mac address we can now sends 
 them. The rest of the packets are added back to the queue.
 
 - Waiting queue -
 
 This is acutally implemented in the IP section, but I believe it is more
 relevant for the ARP implementation. This consists of all the packets we 
 calculate the besr route entry from our table, but the MAC addres for the IP
 address is not yet knowned. So we add it to the queue and send a broadcast
 request to anyone in the network to ask if anyone has the MAC address for
 that specific IP. And then we wait for our reply with the instructions above.
